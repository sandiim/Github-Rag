# Project State

## Current Milestone

Milestone 1 — project contract and local infrastructure.

## Approved Decisions

- Build a single-user React and TypeScript web application with a Python/FastAPI backend.
- Support public and private GitHub repositories using the configured server-side GitHub token.
- Use PostgreSQL with pgvector in Docker for persistent repository, index, and chat data.
- Use local Ollama `llama3.1:latest` for answers and `nomic-embed-text:latest` for embeddings.
- Keep one persistent conversation per repository, titled from the repository name.
- Offer a visible manual rebuild action; compare default-branch commit SHAs and fully rebuild only when changed.
- Use a curated text-file allowlist and exclude dependencies, generated output, lockfiles, binaries, minified files, and oversized files.
- Link citations to exact GitHub commit, path, and inclusive line range.

## Completed

- Removed the previous implementation and initialized a new Git repository on `feat/github-rag-mvp`.
- Approved the architecture design and implementation plan.
- Verified local tooling: Python 3.13.12, Node 24.20.0, Docker 29.1.2, Ollama 0.34.4, `llama3.1:latest`, and `nomic-embed-text:latest`.

## Next

- Complete the project contract commit.
- Create the FastAPI shell, typed settings, and health endpoint.

## Known Risks

- Private-repository access depends on the permissions of the configured GitHub token.
- The selected pgvector Docker image must be pulled before PostgreSQL integration tests can run.
- The current `.env` does not yet contain the optional local database and embedding settings; `.env.example` documents them.

## Verified Commands

- `python --version` — Python 3.13.12
- `node --version` — v24.20.0
- `docker --version` — Docker version 29.1.2
- `ollama list` — `llama3.1:latest` and `nomic-embed-text:latest` installed
